# face-mask-detection
## In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications which are now in high demand for transportation means, densely populated areas, residential districts, large-scale manufacturers and other enterprises to ensure safety.
## Also, the absence of large datasets of ‘with_mask’ images has made this task more cumbersome and challenging.  
## According to current scenario as we know a pandemic is going on all over the world and to get safe from this pandemic we need to do social distancing to avoid this disease to spread and we need to put a mask on our face so that this disease will not transfer from 1 person to another.
## So this is the main idea behind this so that it will help around the world.
